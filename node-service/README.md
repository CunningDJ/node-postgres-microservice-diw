# Node-Postgres Microservice: NodeJS Service Portion
This is the NodeJS service portion of the node-postgres microservice.  It
connects into the database and tables set up in the [database](../db/) portion of
the project.  Make sure to run the [./main/init_dbs.sh](../db/main/init_dbs.sh)
script in the database portion before running the Node service.
