# Node-Postgres Microservice: Mock Data Seeding
This provides a sample executable script (`seed_db.sh`) and its accompanying
scripts (`seed__user_profile.sql` & `seed__article.sql`) for seeding mock data
into the PostgreSQL database.  The integration tests in the `test/` folder
query based on the names of the mock users seeded here.

## Steps
1. Run `seed_db.sh`.
