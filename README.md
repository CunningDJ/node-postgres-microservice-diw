# Node-Postgres Microservice
This is a basic setup for a Node + PostgreSQL microservice.  It can be used
instructionally, as a Hello World for creating such a service, or as
a boilerplate starting point.
The `db/` folder contains the setup scripts and schema for the postgres database, tables and
extensions.
The `node-service/` folder contains the code for the node service that plugs
into the data of this database.
A full explanation of this project can be found at [this Dabbling In Web
article](https://web.dabblingin.com/p/microservice-nodejs-postgresql).
You can also find a more brief treatment of each portion (`db/` and
`node-service/`) in the READMEs of their respective folders.
